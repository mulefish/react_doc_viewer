# TODOs
SplitPane :   
check this: https://codesandbox.io/search?query=react%20split&page=1&configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=12   
NOTE: I did try this but -   
 1: npm showed that it contained 1 'severe' vuln  
 2: I simply could not get it to work w/ Chakra-UI  
 3: W/o Chakta-UI it was nice, but once the UI was complicated with a bunch of DIVs and BUTTONs - when I would drag a split-pane the UI would flicker. I HATE flickering. Boo. 
 
 A good idea - but I guess I will take a pass at this time.  

# Next thought...
